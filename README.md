# To-Do App

A collaborative task management application built with TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. This application helps teams track and manage tasks for small-scale projects, ensuring accountability and clear communication among team members.

# motivation / problem statement
my motivation for starting with this was that i wanted to create an application that can help people communicate tasks on a small scale project like course projects or personal projects.
I have worked on projects and noticed a problem of finding it hard to hold people accountable when they are not doing the job assigned to them, this app would allow for the whole group to be aware about what is going on with the project and allow for clear communication.
